# PM GitHub Starter Kit

Profile templates, project README templates, AI coding prompts, and a 3-week checklist to build a GitHub that gets you hired.

**24% of PM candidates have a GitHub. The latest PMs I placed at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta AI all had one.**

This is the companion repo to [How to Build a PM GitHub](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/you-should-build-a-pm-github) — the web's first guide on PM GitHub profiles.

```

## Quick Start

1. **Fork this repo** (click "Fork" in the top right)
2. **Follow [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md)** — your day-by-day plan
3. **Use the templates** in `templates/` for your profile and project READMEs
4. **Copy the prompts** in `prompts/` into Cursor or Claude Code to build, commit, and document

## The 3-Week Plan

| When | What | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| **Day 1** | Set up your profile | `templates/PROFILE-README.md` |
| **Day 2** | Build and ship your first project | `prompts/build-project.md` |
| **Week 2** | Create your flagship project | `prompts/create-repo.md` |
| **Week 3** | Polish docs, add screenshots, publish | `prompts/write-readme.md` |

See [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) for the full checklist with every step.

## What Makes a Great PM GitHub

Based on analyzing profiles like [Shubham Saboo's](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo) (78K+ stars, went from Dev Rel to Senior AI PM at Google):

1. **One flagship project that solves a real problem** — not scattered toy repos
2. **Crystal clear positioning** — your bio says what you build in one line
3. **Consistent contribution activity** — recent activity beats total stars
4. **Strategic forks and contributions** — contribute to tools in your target domain
5. **Documentation that shows product thinking** — tradeoffs, decisions, learnings
6. **The portfolio effect** — repos that tell a story together

The `PROJECT-README.md` template bakes in the sections hiring managers look for: Problem, Solution, Tradeoffs, and What I Learned.

## What to Avoid

- **Copy-paste repos** — if you can't explain why you chose OpenAI over Claude, you don't understand what you built
- **Joke projects** — a dad-joke chatbot proves nothing about PM skills
- **Green square farming** — hiring managers click the squares. Empty commits are an anti-signal
- **Engineer cosplay** — let AI write clean code. You focus on problem statements, UX, and documentation
- **One-and-done** — a dormant GitHub is worse than no GitHub. Build one small thing per week
