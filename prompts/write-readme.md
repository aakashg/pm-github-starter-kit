# Prompt: Generate a README

Copy and paste into Cursor or Claude Code after your project is working.

---

```
Write a README.md for this project. Follow this structure:

1. Project name and one-sentence description
2. The Problem: what pain point this solves (2-3 sentences, be specific)
3. The Solution: what this tool does (2-3 sentences)
4. How to Use: prerequisites, setup steps, and an example
5. How It Works: brief architecture explanation (3-5 sentences)
6. Tradeoffs: 1-2 decisions I made and why
7. What I Learned: 2-3 real insights from building this
8. Next Steps: 3 improvements I'd make

Write it for a hiring manager who has 2 minutes to understand what I built and how I think. Be specific, not generic.
```

**After the AI generates it, check for:**
- Does the Problem section describe a real pain point someone actually has?
- Does Tradeoffs section show YOUR thinking, not generic "could scale better" filler?
- Does What I Learned contain real insights or just platitudes?
- Would a PM hiring manager learn something about how you think from reading this?

If any answer is no, rewrite that section yourself.
