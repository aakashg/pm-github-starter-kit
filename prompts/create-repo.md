# Prompt: Create a New Repository

Copy and paste this into Cursor (Cmd/Ctrl + K) or Claude Code.

---

```
Create a new public GitHub repository called "[your-project-name]".

Initialize it with:
- A README.md (leave it minimal for now, I'll write it later)
- A .gitignore for Python
- A requirements.txt (empty)
- A main.py with a placeholder comment

Set the repo description to: "[One sentence about what this project does]"
```

---

**Tips:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens for repo names: `ai-email-agent` not `AI Email Agent`
- Always make it public (private repos don't help your profile)
- Keep the initial commit clean — you'll add real code in the next step
